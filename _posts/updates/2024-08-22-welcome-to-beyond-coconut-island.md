Welcome to **Beyond Coconut Island**, my personal website. I'm still trying to iron out exactly what I want to include, but I'm pretty much set on the following as of yet:

- Blogs
- Project journals
- Letters
- Opinions
- Tutorials

This site is a dedicated space for me to broadcast my work and interests without the constraints imposed by mainstream social media and filter bubbles. I intend for the content here to be raw and from the heart.

Feel free to subscribe to the site's [RSS Feed](beyondcoconutisland.blog/feed.xml) to stay informed. Please send any comments, critiques, and complaints to be directed to my site's dedicated email @ [email.me.bci@gmail.com](email.me.bci@gmail.com).
