I took the creative liberty of ditching development of the site in React/JavaScript in favor of Jekyll/Ruby; since this site is purely content-driven and read-only, I figured I'd give your CPU a break and ditch the JavaScript for now. I'm still trying to iron out exactly what I want to include, but I'm pretty much set on the following as of yet:

- Blogs
- Project journals
- _Letters to Anon_
- Opinions

Since Jekyll is proving to be very flexible, this list will probably expand as time goes on. Straight to the point: this site is a dedicated space for me to broadcast my work and interests without the constraints imposed by mainstream social media and filter bubbles. I intend for the content here to be raw and from the heart, and I would encourage anybody else to do the same.

Some of the content, such as posts to _Blogs_ and _Opinions_, will inherently be authored by myself, but I am open to the idea of including submitted works to _Letters to Anon_—last words to a conversation, or moment passed—which would be **anonymously authored and addressed** and publicly displayed in the corresponding _Letters_ tab.

> I'll include a ~~formal~~ set of guidelines for content submissions later on with an ~~official~~ announcement on the home feed. Feel free to subscribe to the site's [RSS Feed](beyondcoconutisland.blog/feed.xml) for now to stay informed. I'm so excited to be sharing a bit about myself with the world here on [Beyond Coconut Island](beyondcoconutisland.blog).

Of course, I encourage any thoughts, comments, critiques, and complaints to be directed to my site's dedicated email @ [email.me.bci@gmail.com](email.me.bci@gmail.com). Kindly prefix your content with your desire to be broadcasted as well, and furthermore, I will never disclose any sender's contact or affiliations.
