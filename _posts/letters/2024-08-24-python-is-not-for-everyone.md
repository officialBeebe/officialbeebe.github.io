Dear Anon,

I felt that I should write you a note regarding your strong opinion that Python is for data science only and that the general population has no business learning the language because Python most certainly _is not_ for everyone. Well, I strongly disagreed with that idea, but I didn't get a chance to clearly explain why. I feel like you can stand to gain from what I have to say, so please read on.

A little over a year ago, I started showing interest in software development, and a good friend of mine mentioned something about pillars and software development, well, I'm not sure if I ended up in the right place but I landed [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-main-pillars-of-learning-programming-and-why-beginners-should-master-them-e04245c17c56/) and that was the start of an exciting journey for me as I ended up on the _freeCodeCamp_. I worked through the _HTML_ course and eventually stumbled upon Dr. Chuck's [Python for Everyone](https://www.py4e.com/) course and the rest is history.

That one course opened up the Pandora's box of software and web development. Since then, I've worked on numerous projects, utilizing various paradigms, frameworks, and languages to build software, including CLI tools written with Node.js or Python; writing C++ sketches for Arduino circuits; a Diablo 2 runeword calculator built with ElectronJS; an OSRS Grand Exchange lookup using React and Express with my best friend's C# API; and the very same site you are reading this letter on, using Ruby and Jekyll to package my Markdown ramblings into static HTML pages.

My point is that for many of those projects, I've used Python for various different use cases besides purely data science needs. For example, I copied and pasted a deeply nested `<table>` from [Pure Diablo](https://www.purediablo.com/diablo-2/runewords) containing all of the information I needed for my runeword calculator, and I used Python with Beautiful Soup to transform the data from the table into a custom data structure as a JSON file that I use locally for my Electron app. In fact, this Electron rendition was originally prototyped as a Python CLI tool.

Clearly, this specific use case is more than a _web scraper_, as you mentioned the other day. I don't know where this misconception came from that Python is only used for data science. Python is a versatile tool that can be used for a wide range of tasks, from shell scripts for automation, using simple libraries to make everyday tasks quicker and easier, or prototyping and building data structures for software development. I don't see a need to gatekeep. It's okay to take pride in your craft, but you need to understand that there are many tools in the toolbox and countless ways to solve a problem with them.
