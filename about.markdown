Welcome to _Beyond Coconut Island_, my official blog. My name is Dylan and I am an aspiring Software Engineer. I am currently studying online at Western Governor's University. I consider tech to be one of my passions and I'm always experimenting with or exploring somethings new. 

I created this blog as a way to flex my creative writing muscles and express myself in a way free of constraints that traditional social media platforms impose. I encourage you to check out what I got and send me an email @ [email.me.bci@gmail.com](mailto:email.me.bci@gmail.com) if you wish to comment, complain, or critique. 

Enjoy your stay!
